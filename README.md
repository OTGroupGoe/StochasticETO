## Overview
This repo provides code to generate data and to plot figures in "Entropic transfer operators for stochastic systems"

## Getting started
* [data_convection](./data_convection/) contains raw data from the lab, see section 3.3 in article for more details.
* [get_results_torus.ipynb](./get_results_torus.ipynb) and [get_results_convection.ipynb](./get_results_convection.ipynb) are used to simulate/process data that are required in the plots, by default the results are saved to folder [results_torus](./results_torus/) and [results_convection](./results_convection/) (which are currently empty) respectively. [get_results_convection.ipynb](./get_results_convection.ipynb) is suggested to run on machine with GPU.

* [Given_results_torus](./Given_results_torus/) and [Given_results_convection](./Given_results_convection/) contain pre-generated data from us to save your time.

* [plot_figs_torus.ipynb](./plot_figs_torus.ipynb) and [plot_figs_convection.ipynb](./plot_figs_convection.ipynb) are code for plotting the figures 2-5 and 6-10 respectively.
